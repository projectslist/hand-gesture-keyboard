# Hand Gesture Keyboard
This is a Python project that uses computer vision to recognise hand gestures and use them as input to simulate keyboard typing.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- cvzone
- numpy
- pynput

## Installation
- Clone the repo
``git clone https://github.com/projectslist/hand-gesture-keyboard.git``

- Install the dependencies
``pip install opencv-python cvzone numpy pynput
``
- Run the script
``python hand-gesture-keyboard.py
``

# Usage
This program uses the computer's camera to capture live video feed of the user's hand movements. The user can then interact with the virtual keyboard by moving their hand over the keys.

To type a letter, the user must move their hand over the corresponding key and pinch their index finger and thumb together. The letter will then be typed into the text box displayed on screen.
